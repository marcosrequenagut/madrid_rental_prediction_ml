# Predicting Rental Prices in Madrid

This is a personal project. The goal is to predict rental prices for properties in Madrid using Machine Learning techniques and present the results interactively through a dashboard.

---

##  Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess real estate data
- Train and compare various prediction models (e.g., KNN, Random Forest)
- Evaluate model performance using test data
- Create an interactive dashboard for visualization

- **Programming language:** Python
- **Data analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Geographic visualization:** Folium
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit (or Dash)
- **Development tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, PyCharm
